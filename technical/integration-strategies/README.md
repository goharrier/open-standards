# Integration Strategies

We'll be discussing typical integration strategies we employ with our customers. These are not strategies that you'll find in Salesforce documentation, nor do they utilise the Salesforce stack.

As always, our solutions aim to support customers, rather than maximising the Salesforce footprint. Therefore we'll be naming technologies that are often less restrictive, non-proprietary or less cost prohibitive than Salesforce.
