# Documentation

Functional documentation focuses on the narratives of completed stories. When acceptance criteria are clearly defined and articulated, the collective sum of these stories should illustrate a comprehensive behavioral overview.&#x20;

Nonetheless, there exists a necessity for overarching business process documentation. This is accomplished not through written documentation but via flowcharts.

BPMN or alternative notations may be employed, provided they clearly delineate the various stages in a process, including their prerequisites or conditions that are assessed, and the subsequent effects across systems or stakeholders.
