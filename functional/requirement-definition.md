# Requirement definition

Requirements should be formatted in a consistent way and always contain 3 main elements:

* Requirement (User Story) definition itself (_As a_ x, _I want to be able to_ y, _so that_ z)
* Acceptance Criteria (written in [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/): given, when, then)
* High level solution design notes

{% hint style="info" %}
We do not distinguish the definition of a requirement between theoretical models, nor do we live by "the book" when it comes to _Scrum_, _Agile or_ _Waterfall_.
{% endhint %}
