# Requirement definition

Requirements should be formatted in a consistent way and always contain 3 main elements:

* Requirement (User Story) definition itself (_As a_ x, _I want to be able to_ y, _so that_ z)
* Acceptance Criteria (written in [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/): given, when, then)
* High level solution design notes

{% hint style="info" %}
We do not distinguish between the definitions of requirements in theoretical models, nor do we strictly adhere to 'the book' when it comes to Scrum, Agile, or Waterfall methodologies.
