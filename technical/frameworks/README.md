# Frameworks

We strongly advocate for using open source frameworks, which offer several key advantages:

* Avoiding duplication of efforts by not reinventing the wheel.
* Ensuring consistency across all projects and organizations.
* Maintaining a flexible connection between our team and our customers. If we develop useful technology, we should build it on top of these frameworks, or consider creating our own framework to address specific issues, with a preference for open sourcing these solutions. Our goal is to avoid creating proprietary technology that results in vendor lock-in.

These sections outline the frameworks we use in our projects and their benefits. While each framework is extensively documented elsewhere, our focus here is to discuss the pitfalls, opportunities, and reasoning behind our decision to adopt or use these frameworks in our projects.
