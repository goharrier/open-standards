# Architecture Patterns

This section documents architectural patterns and principles that guide the structure and organization of Salesforce implementations at Harrier. These patterns ensure scalability, maintainability, and alignment with enterprise best practices.

## Architecture Documentation

This section will contain detailed architecture patterns and implementation guidelines as they are developed and documented based on production implementations.

## Core Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Distinct layers for presentation, business logic, and data access
2. **Loose Coupling** - Minimize dependencies between components
3. **High Cohesion** - Group related functionality together
4. **Domain-Driven Design** - Organize around business domains
5. **Dependency Inversion** - Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

## Architectural Layers

### Presentation Layer
- Lightning Web Components
- Visualforce Pages
- Experience Cloud Components

### Business Logic Layer
- Service Classes
- Domain Classes
- Selector Classes

### Data Access Layer
- Unit of Work Pattern
- Repository Pattern
- Query Builders

## Decision Criteria

When making architectural decisions, consider:
- Business domain boundaries
- Team structure and ownership
- Deployment cadence requirements
- Integration points
- Performance requirements
- Compliance and security needs

## Evolution Strategy

Architecture should evolve through:
- Regular architectural reviews
- Proof of concepts for new patterns
- Incremental improvements
- Documentation of decisions and rationale
- Team education and knowledge sharing
