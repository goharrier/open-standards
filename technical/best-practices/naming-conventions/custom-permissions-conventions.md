# Custom Permissions Conventions

All Naming Conventions Are [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) and [RFC 6919](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6919) compliant.

1. All Permission API names **MUST** be written in English, even when the label is in another language.
2. All Permission API names **MUST** be written in PascalCase.
3. Permissions **SHOULD NOT** contain an underscore in the API name, except where explicitly defined otherwise in these conventions.
